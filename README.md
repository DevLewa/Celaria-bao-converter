# Celaria-bao-converter
.bao animation file generator for the game "Celaria"

How it works:
Animation frames (.obj model files) are placed in a "source" directory located in the root directory of the converter.
This "source" directory is then scanned by the application which then generates .bao files
and places them in a "converted" directory which is also placed in the root path of the converter.
